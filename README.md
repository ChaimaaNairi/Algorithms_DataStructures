# Data Structures
This repository contains implementations of different data structures using the C programming language.</br>

Each data structure is implemented in its own subdirectory, with a README file explaining the purpose and usage of the data structure. Additionally, each directory contains a set of sample programs that demonstrate the usage of the data structure. The code is well-commented and designed for readability.
