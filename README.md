# Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository contains implementation of various algorithms and data structures in C programming language.

</br>

Each Algorithm & data structure is implemented in its own subdirectory, with a README file explaining the purpose and usage of the data structure. Additionally, each directory contains a set of sample programs that demonstrate the usage of the data structure. The code is well-commented and designed for readability.
