# h1 - LinkedList
<h3>h1-1: Doubly linked list Algorithm</h3>
This C program contains the necessary algorithm to store data entered by the user in Doubly linked lists.

<h3>h1-2: Searching on Linked List Using Binary Search Algorithm</h3>
This program searches for a value entered by the user in a doubly linked list with random numerical values using the binary search algorithm, and if found, prints its position to the screen.

<h3>h1-3: Solution of Josephus Problem</h3>
This program solves the Josephus Problem using a singly circular linked list. The Josephus Problem is a problem used to calculate which person will be the last survivor in a circular arrangement of n people when one person is selected for death out of every k people.</br>
<h4>How to Use?</h4>
After running the program, the user is asked for the number of people (n) and then the value of k (every kth person will be killed). After entering these values, the program prints the number of the last survivor to the screen.</br>
<h4>Algorithm</h4>
The program solves the Josephus Problem using a singly circular linked list. First, the people are placed properly on the singly circular linked list. Then, a person is removed from the list and the kth person in the list is selected. This process is repeated until only the last person in the list remains.
