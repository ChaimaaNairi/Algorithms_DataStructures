# h2 - Stack&Queue

<h3>h2-1: Palindrome Detection</h3>
This program determines whether a given string is a palindrome or not. The program does not consider punctuation, capitalization, and spaces. It is designed using both stack and queue data structures.</br>

<h3>h2-2: Queue Structure</h3>
This program creates a number list using the queue structure and various operations can be performed on this list. The program takes numbers as input from the user and then adds them to the queue.</br>

<h3>h2-3: Radix Sort</h3>
Radix sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts numbers by grouping them by digits. This algorithm was implemented using the queue data structure.</br>
1- Starting with the highest digit, the elements are placed in the queues according to each digit.</br>
2- Starting with the lowest digit, the elements in each queue are taken and placed in the array in a sorted order.</br>
3- This process continues from the highest digit to the lowest digit.
