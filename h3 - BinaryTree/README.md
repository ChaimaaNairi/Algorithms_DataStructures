# h3 - BinaryTree

<h3>h3-1: Function to check if a given model is a tree</h3>
In this project, a function is implemented in C language to check if a given model is a tree or not.</br>

<h3>h3-2: Binary Tree Creation Function</h3>
This C program contains a function that creates a binary tree for a given mathematical expression. The program shows an example usage for the following expression:</br>
(x+y/z) â€“ (A^2+4*B) </br>
The program creates the binary tree for the expression and prints the inorder traversal of the tree to the screen.</br>
Inorder traversal refers to the process of visiting the nodes of a tree in a sequential order. During this traversal, the left subtree is visited first, followed by the root node, and then the right subtree.</br>

<h3>h3-3: 5-Depth Binary Tree Created with Random Numbers</h3>
This program creates a binary tree with 5 levels using random numbers and prints the preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal results of the tree to the screen. </br>
