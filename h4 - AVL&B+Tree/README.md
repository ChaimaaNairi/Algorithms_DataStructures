<h3>h4-1: Deletion Operation in AVL Trees</h3>
This program explains how to perform deletion operation in AVL tree data structure using C language. </br>
The program takes input from the user for the values of nodes to be inserted in the AVL tree and adds them to the tree. The user can also enter the value of the node to be deleted.
